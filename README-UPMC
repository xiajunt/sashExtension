The file "eval.c" content fonction for transforming the arithmetic expression into arithmetic tree and fonction for resolving this tree.
Structure of the tree :

typedef struct arith_tree
{
  int type;
  int num_val;
  struct arith_tree *left;
  struct arith_tree *right;
}arith_tree;

"left" and "right" are pointer for the two children of this node
"type" define the type of the node, a node can be a number or a operator(+, -, x, /)
"num_val" is the value of the node if it's a number

Possible error :

_Division by 0, not deal yet, so don't use it please
_Wrong formulate expression, if the expression is not well formulate, the program will ignore the command and show a message

Warning :

In the program, mult "*" is replaced by "x" and "[]" is replaced by "()"
